5:33 | Jorge Zúñiga: Hola, buen día desde México!
6:08 | Microsoft Reactor: @Tim Mackey we are sharing at 1080 - it may just be an artifact of being live! Make sure your YT settings are for highest quality playbac
8:57 | Lakshmi M (LakshmisWork): Thank you so much for this series, it is indeed very usefu
9:14 | GPS: hi everyone
9:27 | GPS: ready for class #
9:51 | Leo: Love FastAPI and Pydantic solid librarie
9:53 | Georgian Pirvu: looks like Object-oriented programming clas
11:04 | Kevin Kawchak: How long does it take to switch between new requests (once everything is set up)
11:23 | GPS: @Kevin Kawchak what do you mean switch request
13:31 | John C: The response retruned Date as Friday, was expecting to return a dat
13:52 | Ammar Ahmed: does this work for large text (like extracting keyfields from a 10 page contract)?
14:33 | Kristopher Betz (kjbetz): Is there a similar library for C# like Pydantic
15:58 | Kristopher Betz (kjbetz): Disregard maybe... I thought Pydantic was making a wrapper for the structured output, looks like more of a validation library
16:05 | GPS: @Kristopher Betz (kjbetz) isn't that sorta built into C#?
16:16 | Edmar Souza: By structured output I was thinking in scenarios like the case where gave a input prompt I want my agent AI , answer an IAC code. fir example Terraform files and structur
17:24 | GPS: it all comes back to json!
17:57 | Kristopher Betz (kjbetz): What is turning model into json_schema
18:06 | GPS: like scooby doo unmasking a ghost
18:26 | Leo: I think YY-MM-DD is an invalid date format in Python. Y-mm-d
18:38 | Leo: Capital M is minute
19:11 | Kristopher Betz (kjbetz): Got it, thanks... will need to look up the way to do that with C# libraries
21:02 | N S: you are actually very clear :
25:34 | Kevin Kawchak: It seems like for multiple LLM manufacturers, I get back JSON for complex tasks, unless I explicitly state "Full Python Script
25:54 | Ammar Ahmed: if certain field not found in the context, does the JSON_SCHEMA defaults to NaN (or alternative) or just fail

27:30 | A F: Hi from nyc
28:02 | Daniel: wonde
29:23 | GPS: lo
29:25 | GPS: just exit i
34:48 | N S: what if it is using js?
35:37 | N S: <
36:41 | BrayanVB: any chance you can share this example
36:58 | Pablo C: what about your feet?
37:12 | Poorna Raavi: like AI agents
37:53 | bzrgrl: cpld you please share the github path to the javascript webpage scraping . Thank
38:57 | Microsoft Reactor: http://github.com/pamelafox/personal-linkedin-agent
39:15 | BrayanVB: thank you
39:30 | GPS: hahah
41:57 | Pablo C: can we define optional and mandatory elements
44:11 | Pablo C: or we ask to github copilot ..
47:26 | Pablo C: does it also get information from tables in a docx
49:00 | K Rowan: How would you approach dynamically categorizing responses (e.g., food group) without a providing a specified list
49:01 | Jorge Zúñiga: @Pablo C Pydantic optional fields
51:20 | Kevin Kawchak: I have several API notebooks for different manufacturers, but am always troubleshooting them. It seems like chat is always faster for most tasks as I can specify for it to follow code structures
51:52 | Leo: So for LLMs like GPT5, pre-training data from files like word/pdf first gets extacted from files and then used as training data
53:08 | Pablo C: what would you suggest to verify how the model is doing it? I mean, something similar to document intelligence with percentages of confidence
53:44 | Microsoft Reactor: Still have questions? Join the office hours on Tuesdays at 11 AM PT: https://aka.ms/pythonai/oh
54:09 | Steve Wolfe: looking forward to the office hours. - thanks. :
56:25 | Austin Audu: couldnt you just use the Azure AI Foundry for comparison
57:22 | Sam Nageub: How do you balance flexibility (LLMs are creative) vs. strict structure (Pydantic is rigid)
57:42 | N S: forcing a structured output generally increases the tokens being used
58:02 | Oli Baylis: Request a confidence score to be returned by the LLM as part of the structured data
58:54 | Sam Nageub: that was an absolutely very informative and useful session. thank you so much for your sharing your knowledge.
58:57 | Pablo C: MIstral OCR in Azure AI Foundry is a good optio
1:00:36 | John Cupples: numbers and music are usually saf
1:01:30 | bzrgrl: can you ask llm to output a strcutre, sy in json, by itself, without actually providing a structure definition in the prompt
1:01:37 | Microsoft Reactor: If you have a few moments, please fill out our Reactor Survey. We appreciate the feedback! Event ID: 26296https://aka.ms/Reactor/Survey 
1:01:42 | Leo: property_name: Optional[str] is how you mark attributes as optiona

1:02:23 | Kristopher Betz (kjbetz): Thanks, Pamela! Great as always
1:02:24 | Kevin Kawchak: Thank yo
1:02:26 | BrayanVB: Thank you!!
1:02:27 | Rodrigo: Thank You!!
1:02:29 | Ryan Price: Thanks from Colorad
1:02:32 | bzrgrl: Thank you for another great session
1:02:38 | aquarist123: Thank you that was great
1:02:39 | Joel Muhoho: Thank yo
1:02:43 | Austin Audu: Thank you
1:02:45 | Peter Anny-Nzekwue: Thank yo
1:02:47 | Pamela Fox: @Leo Optional[str] is somewhat outdated syntax, so it depends on Python version. Thats why my editor gave a warning when I started off with Optional[str]
1:02:52 | John C: Thanks 
1:02:54 | Leo: Thank yo
1:03:00 | Phila Mavikane: T
1:03:02 | Microsoft Reactor: Thanks for joining! We'll see you at the next one
1:03:19 | Pamela Fox: @Leo So I replaced Optional[int] with int|None - both should generate the same JSON schema, I believe, but I could double check the log
1:03:22 | Leo: Interesting, thanks for the heads u
1:03:55 | Pamela Fox: @Leo For sure, thanks for looking it u
1:04:00 | Pamela Fox: See you all tomorrow
